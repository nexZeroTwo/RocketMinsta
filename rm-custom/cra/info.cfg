addinfo "Some maps contain Buffs - kind of permanent powerups. Usually, Buffs are bound to teams and located on their respective bases. Once a Buff has been taken, it will not respawn until the player holding it dies or leaves the game. You may have only one Buff active at once and you can't grab Buffs from an enemy teams's base."

addinfo "The ^4Guard^7 Buff will make your health and armor regenerate up to 150. In addition to that, it will instantly heal you up to 100 health and armor on pickup."

addinfo "The ^5Arc^7 Buff will enhance your weapon with a chain lightning effect. Your hits will bounce off the target to nearby enemies recursively. However, damage is reduced by 45% with each jump and it won't hit a single target more than once. Best used against a pack of enemies, as it doesn't give you any 1on1 advantage."

addinfo "The ^2Supply^7 Buff will increase your Rifle's magazine capacity up to 12, boost nadget regeneration rate by 20% and increase the value of all pickups by 50% (including mega healths and large armors!)"

addinfo "The ^3Haste^7 Buff will increase your movement speed by 20% and reduce shooting and nadget cooldowns by 25%."

addinfo "While the Reflective Shield is active, dodging, walljump and all Buff effects are temporarily disabled."

addinfo "In Jailbreak, the jail is unlocked by capturing a control point. Enemy points get assigned to your team, which gives an extra jailbreak opportunity to the enemy team later. You should attempt to take the yellow control point(s) and prevent the other team from doing so. However, be prepared to attack their base if that fails, and don't forget to defend yours!"

addinfo "Watch out for Fire Traps. They are often placed on strategically important areas such as Jailbreak/Domination control points. You can shoot the trap with the rifle, which will cause it to explode as if it was your own projectile. You will still take damage from the fire if you get too close, but your team will not."

addinfo "Plasma Bombs, Fire Traps and Napalm Grenades can be very effective at preventing mass revivals and control point captures."

addinfo "Reflective Shields initially return all damage back to the attacker, but the reflection factor diminishes to zero over the duration. This is represented by the shield color. Blue-ish shields are mostly safe to shoot at as long as you aren't on low health. It's usually best to run away from newly popped shields and wait until they expire."

addinfo "Press the Hook key (E by default) to use your Nadget. Some of them require you to hold the key down to accumulate throw force. Some of them may also be manually triggered using the Drop Weapon key (G by default)."

addinfo "Hold the Drop Flag key (F by default) to use the hook. It's a great tool to drag frozen players."

addinfo "In Freezetag, stand next to your frozen team mates to bring them back to action, and maybe the'll do the same to you when you get in trouble!"

addinfo "You can use the Fire key to place ^xFB0ENEMY SEEN^7 marks for your team while frozen."

addinfo "Double-tap the movement keys to quickly dash in your movement direction. Very useful to quickly get away from danger. Combine with wall jumping for singnificantly faster movement around the map."

addinfo "If you hit an enemy with the Translocator, you'll instantly telefrag them, even if they are protected by a Reflective Shield. However, this doesn't work against VIPs."
