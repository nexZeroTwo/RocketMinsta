seta sv_chat_autoreplace_order "" "An ordered list of replacements to apply, separated by space"

//		HOW TO CONFIGURE CHAT AUTOREPLACEMENTS
//
//	Each replacement has an "id", which is a simple identificator of a source->replacement pair.
//	Each source->replacement pair is defined with two cvars:
//
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_$ID_src "the text to replace"
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_$ID_rep "the replacement text"
//
//	To make a source->replacement pair active, you have to add it into sv_chat_autoreplace_order.
//	If no _src is provived, the id itself is assumed to be the source word.
//	Note: the order of replacements matters! Consider the following example:
//
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_fuck_src "fuck"
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_fuck_rep "love"
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_fucking_src "fucking"
//		set sv_chat_autoreplace_fucking_rep "awesome"
//		sv_chat_autoreplace_order "fuck fucking"
//
//	On a string like "Not this fucking map again!" it will result into:
//		"Not this loveing map again!" (instead of "Not this awesome map again!")
//	This happens because the "fuck" replacement get checked before "fucking" and eats a part of what "fucking" would replace.
//	In short, it's a good idea to put replacements with longer _src values before the shorter ones.
